# Kevin Song
**PhD Researcher | AI Developer | Computational Biomedical Engineer**

🔬 I build **AI systems that model intelligence in biology and data**, merging deep learning, network science, and quantitative reasoning.  
⚙️ My focus is on creating **interpretable and scalable architectures** that bridge biological computation, systems design, and algorithmic strategy.  
🧩 Every model I design functions as a living system — modular, transparent, and self-consistent across abstraction layers.

## 🧬 Engineering Philosophy

> “Architecture is intelligence made visible.”

- **Systemic Design:** Treat each codebase as a model of interaction—between data, algorithms, and hypotheses.  
- **Analytical Transparency:** Ensure traceable reasoning between biological mechanisms and model predictions.  
- **Minimalist Infrastructure:** Favor modular architectures and automated testing over manual complexity.  
- **Cross-Domain Abstraction:** Apply shared principles of optimization, feedback, and emergence to all problem spaces.  
- **Reproducible Science:** Integrate CI/CD, containerization, and documentation for durable research ecosystems.
